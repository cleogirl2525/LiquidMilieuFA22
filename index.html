      <h3>
        FEATURING WORK BY
      </h3>
  
 <h4>Sharalyn Berry</h4><br>
      Sharalyn Berry's work consists of simulated altered states of consciousness related to her new transformed perceptions after becoming a born-again believer in Jesus Christ. She mostly uses 2D animation, video, and other hybrid mediums, as these mediums bring the fantastical and otherworldly to life in a lens we can understand. Through Sharalyn's creations, she produces allusions and metaphors of the Bible where she can express her spiritual experiences relating to different everyday activities the Bible influences.
    
		<h4>Kat Chiroque </h4> 
      K	at Chiroque creates mixed media works primarily using digital mediums while also occasionally using paint or gouache. Their art style has a pop culture feeling to it with an abundance of purple and blue tones. Their animated works have featured repetition and occasional randomness.
   
			<h4>Carmelita Garza </h4>
    
    Carmelita Garza is a up and coming artist currently based in Richmond, Virginia. She has a primary background in animation and 2D art. She hopes to create art that brings a smile to people’s faces. While there is not an overarching theme in place, she often creates works about her interests or certain things on her mind, but most importantly she aims to make work using POC people. As a POC woman herself, she strives to make work with people that look like her.
      
<h4>Diego Gomez Garcia </h4>
    Diego Gomez is a primarily digital artist who works with video, animation, photography and 3D.<br><br>
    Growing up the youngest in an immigrant family, he combines the foreign values instilled in him with the domestic ones to criticize the more ridiculous aspects of American culture that largely go unnoticed. Most notably the protest of the standard of the digital art needing to be crisp and Hi-Def to be legitimate, finding beauty and meaning in the rustic quality of “outdated” technology, fostered by growing up in a family that was always 2-3 generations behind the current standard but managing perfectly well despite that, as well as being the recipient of many hand-me-downs. <br> <br> Many of his works deal with urban environments and use of sounds and light to immerse the viewer into a looming yet beautiful world.

 <h4>	Rose Khoury </h4>
      Motivated by a longing for a bearable collective existence, the work I create approaches the overwhelming nature of what is a no longer hypothetical future. Trying to encounter understanding through the confusion of interpersonal relationships, my drawings address loneliness, longing, the joyous vulnerability that intimacy offers, the teetering confusion and insecurity that erotic relations inevitably invite. Ideas about a permissible existence appear within my work primarily in terms of how I address restraint and degradation as it relates to our environment and the body. I’m attempting to recontextualize a preoccupation with control, tasking myself with intentional cultivation. In defiance of deterioration maturation manifests through such somatic modifications as transgender deformation and handpoke tattoo as an attempt to heal/guard the body and psyche. Through material research in fermentation, discard, and utility, the presence of permission extends as the need to create work that addresses concerns of physical/ecological consumption; allowing my work to rot, regenerate, and reanimate. The literal growth and decay is intimately interwoven with the cultivation of self I'm encountering, recognizing my work as an extension and attempted understanding of new life, new embodiment.
    
 <h4>	Mallory Laing </h4>
    Mallory Laing creates sound and video based media, as well as drawn 2d visual work. She does commissions for digital art collages, including music covers, posters, or any visualizers needed.

By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience through video. Bautista tries to focus on the activity of presenting. The character, shape or content of the presented artwork is secondary. The essential things are the momentary and the intention of presenting. This can be visually seen in his music videos( included on MixtapeMadness, Dearxch TV, and PressplayMedia under the Alias name " smakvisuals")<br><br>The results of the videos are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. By applying abstraction in his videos, he touches various overlapping themes and strategies. Several reoccurring subject matter can be recognized, such as the relation with popular culture and media. Working with repetition, provocation and the investigation of the process of expectations.<br><br> His works often refers to pop and mass culture.

 <h4>	Aris Pi</h4>
    The love of existence in all forms is what Aris is passionate about. Memory is the only thing that keeps us in this reality since we all just live inside the minds of others.

    <br>
      Students of VCU Art’s Video Concepts Class within the department of Kinetic Imaging are excited to present Liquid Milieu, an online screening of multimedia videos that explore supernatural, narrative, and abstract elements. Conversations within the works include intimacy, passion, finding our sense of self, as well as the power we have within ourselves. This exhibition is a galaxy; each student’s imagination is mashed together into a supernova blurred lines between method, making, and meaning. Experiencing the barrage of images becomes overwhelming at times and accents the diversity of perspectives and aesthetics. What discoveries can be made in the shared sea of wayfinding? We are a body of water.

      <h3>Khanh Mai Doan</h3><br> Khanh Mai Doan was born in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam in 2002. Despite not coming from a family with an art tradition, she soon found her interest in drawing at a very young age through reading comics and watching animated films. Throughout her time at AIS, a bilingual school where she studied for 10 years, Khanh was able to nurture her passion upon several art competitions, both in school and around HCMC, earning her an Award of Innovative Idea during 9th grade. Having her focus shift into filmmaking, Khanh decided to further challenge herself with the IB Diploma program at EF Academy New York in the last two years of high school. As a senior, she was nominated for IB Visual Arts HL and IB Psychology SL Student of the Year (with winning the latter one), both of which have greatly contributed to her perspective and skills on her learning journey as a filmmaker. In her free time, she can be found exploring the complexity of human’s mind and behavior artistically through photography, film editing/reviewing as well as graphic design. Khanh is currently a freshman at School of the Art Institute Chicago pursuing a BFA in Film.

My creative ideas do not usually manifest in a structured manner. My ideas seem to manifest the most in times of great distress or sometimes mass euphoria. For me, it is all about the mood and the impact; the lighting and ambiance sets the tone, allowing me to capture the raw image I see in my mind. During covid the lack of connection to not only friends and family but the world made creating script based works that include actors harder to do. This turned my focus into things I could do at home more easily which brought my focus to collage based ideas where I was able to take various images or footage and create a new meaning/understanding through this presentation.<br><br>

Her hair is very short, just above the top of her ears, and there is a pair of green earrings dangling under her earlobes. Her eyebrows are sparse, always drooping slightly, which make her seem a bit frustrating. The most prominent part of her face is her eyes. The eyes are filled with sharp light like blades even though the canthus is slashed with fine winkles. This kind of light was hidden while her eyelids were drooping, but most of the time, she stares at the pedestrians passing by. It is a gaze that does not contain any maliciousness. If you observe carefully, it may contain a certain amount of curiosity. Although she is a short woman and often squats on the overpass, her pure and unreserved gaze can even make passers-by who look at her look away.<br><br>
