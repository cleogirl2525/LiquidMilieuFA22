# LiquidMilieuFA22

**This repo is for VCU's FA33 Video Concepts Class public screening.** 

Students of VCU Art’s Video Concepts Class within the department of Kinetic Imaging are excited to present Liquid Milieu, an online screening of multimedia videos that explore supernatural, narrative, and abstract elements. Conversations within the works include intimacy, passion, finding our sense of self, as well as the power we have within ourselves. This exhibition is a galaxy; each student’s imagination is mashed together into a supernova blurred lines between method, making, and meaning. Experiencing the barrage of images becomes overwhelming at times and accents the diversity of perspectives and aesthetics. What discoveries can be made in the shared sea of wayfinding? We are a body of water.
